                <p>
                    MerceEdge's core abstract models include:
                </p>

                <li>
                    Component
                </li>
                <p>
                    A component is a mapping that represents a real physical IOT device, 
                    and the user does not need any code implementation. 
                    The component relies on the interface to input and output data to MerceEdge.
                </p>
                
                <li>Interface</li>
                <p>
                    The interface is divided into input (Input) and output (Output), 
                    the interface can reflect various IOT communication protocols, 
                    and can also be used as communication between MerceEdge internal Wireload.
                </p>

                <li>Wire</li>
                <p>
                    Wired connections to a variety of different interfaces allow IOT heterogeneous protocols to be fused 
                    together through MerceEdge internal communications.
                </p>

                <li>Wireload</li>
                <p>
                    A Wiredload is a special component that handles the flow of data on a wire. 
                    Users need to code their own wireload implementation
                </p>

                <li>Formula</li>
                <p>
                    The Formula is a solution to organize the configuration of components, interfaces, wires, and wireloads.
